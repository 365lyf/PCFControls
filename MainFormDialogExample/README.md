This is an example of a PCF that uses the Main Form Dialog (or navigateTo) feature within Model Apps to open an Account main form.

Main Form Dialogs were introduced to Model Apps in 2020 Wave 1 release.

Limitations:
- The entity type is hard coded presently.  Feel free to change or convert this to an input parameter.
- Window sizing is hard coded to 70%.  Again feel free to change or convert to an input parameter.
- This will ONLY work on MODEL APPS!  And only instances that have Wave 1 2020 Release installed!

Other than that, hope you find it useful.

Cheers
