This PCF Control example doesn't actually perform any action but it aims to demonstrate one thing.
* HOW TO USE AN ICON (in this case a font-awesome icon) WITHIN A BUTTON ON A CONTROL

This has been especially challenging for some as it was uncertain if we could embed external resources within our PCF controls.  In this case we've imported the font-awesome css file from:
"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.9.0/css/all.css" and used this as the basis of our icons within the PCF control.

Thanks to Mo Mostafa for the challenge it was fun :)
